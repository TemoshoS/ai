        <h2>AI in Action</h2>
        <p><strong>What is AI?</strong><br>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and problem-solve. It involves various technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Why is AI Important?</strong><br>AI is important because it enhances efficiency, automates repetitive tasks, and enables intelligent decision-making. It is revolutionizing industries such as healthcare, finance, education, and transportation by improving accuracy and speed while reducing human error.</p>
    
        <p><strong>How Does AI Work?</strong><br>AI works by processing vast amounts of data, recognizing patterns, and learning from the information. For example, machine learning algorithms enable AI systems to identify patterns and improve over time without explicit programming. This is how self-driving cars can make decisions based on real-time data or how AI-driven chatbots understand and respond to human queries.</p>
    
        <p>AI is used in healthcare for diagnosing diseases, in finance for fraud detection, and in self-driving cars for navigation. It is continuously evolving, offering endless possibilities while raising important ethical concerns that need to be addressed.</p>
