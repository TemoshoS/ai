        <h2>AI in Action</h2>
        <p><strong>What is AI?</strong><br>AI (Artificial Intelligence) is when machines are made to think and learn like humans. It includes things like robots, chatbots, and systems that can solve problems and make decisions on their own.</p>

        <p><strong>Why is AI Important?</strong><br>AI is important because it helps us work faster, reduces mistakes, and can do tasks that would be hard for people. Itâ€™s changing industries like healthcare, finance, and transport by making things more accurate and quicker.</p>

        <p><strong>How Does AI Work?</strong><br>AI works by looking at large amounts of data and learning from it. It can identify patterns and improve over time. For example, AI in self-driving cars uses data from sensors to make decisions, while chatbots can understand and reply to messages.</p>

        <p>AI is already being used in healthcare for diagnosing diseases, in finance to spot fraud, and in self-driving cars to navigate. It keeps improving, offering new possibilities, but also raises important questions that need to be thought about carefully.</p>
